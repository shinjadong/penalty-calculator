[App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) [Getting Started](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started) Route Handlers and Middleware

## Route Handlers and Middleware

## Route Handlers

Route Handlers allow you to create custom request handlers for a given route using the Web [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request) and [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Response) APIs.

![Route.js Special File](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Froute-special-file.png&w=1920&q=75)

Route.js Special File

> **Good to know**: Route Handlers are only available inside the `app` directory. They are the equivalent of [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) inside the `pages` directory meaning you **do not** need to use API Routes and Route Handlers together.

### Convention

Route Handlers are defined in a [`route.js|ts` file](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route) inside the `app` directory:

app/api/route.ts

```
export async function GET(request: Request) {}
```

Route Handlers can be nested anywhere inside the `app` directory, similar to `page.js` and `layout.js`. But there **cannot** be a `route.js` file at the same route segment level as `page.js`.

### Supported HTTP Methods

The following [HTTP methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) are supported: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS`. If an unsupported method is called, Next.js will return a `405 Method Not Allowed` response.

### Extended NextRequest and NextResponse APIs

In addition to supporting the native [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request) and [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Response) APIs, Next.js extends them with [`NextRequest`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/next-request) and [`NextResponse`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/next-response) to provide convenient helpers for advanced use cases.

### Caching

Route Handlers are not cached by default. You can, however, opt into caching for `GET` methods. Other supported HTTP methods are **not** cached. To cache a `GET` method, use a [route config option](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#dynamic) such as `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` in your Route Handler file.

> **Good to know**: Other supported HTTP methods are **not** cached, even if they are placed alongside a `GET` method that is cached, in the same file.

### Special Route Handlers

Special Route Handlers like [`sitemap.ts`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/sitemap), [`opengraph-image.tsx`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/opengraph-image), and [`icon.tsx`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/app-icons), and other [metadata files](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata) remain static by default unless they use Dynamic APIs or dynamic config options.

### Route Resolution

You can consider a `route` the lowest level routing primitive.

- They **do not** participate in layouts or client-side navigations like `page`.
- There **cannot** be a `route.js` file at the same route as `page.js`.

| Page | Route | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app/page.js` | `app/route.js` | Conflict |
| `app/page.js` | `app/api/route.js` | Valid |
| `app/[user]/page.js` | `app/api/route.js` | Valid |

Each `route.js` or `page.js` file takes over all HTTP verbs for that route.

app/page.ts

```
export default function Page() {

  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>

}

 

// Conflict

// \`app/route.ts\`

export async function POST(request: Request) {}
```

Read more about how Route Handlers [complement your frontend application](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/backend-for-frontend), or explore the Route Handlers [API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route).

### Route Context Helper

In TypeScript, you can type the `context` parameter for Route Handlers with the globally available [`RouteContext`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route#route-context-helper) helper:

app/users/\[id\]/route.ts

```
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

 

export async function GET(_req: NextRequest, ctx: RouteContext<'/users/[id]'>) {

  const { id } = await ctx.params

  return Response.json({ id })

}
```

> **Good to know**
> 
> - Types are generated during `next dev`, `next build` or `next typegen`.

## Middleware

Middleware allows you to run code before a request is completed. Then, based on the incoming request, you can modify the response by rewriting, redirecting, modifying the request or response headers, or responding directly.

### Use cases

Some common scenarios where Middleware is effective include:

- Quick redirects after reading parts of the incoming request
- Rewriting to different pages based on A/B tests or experiments
- Modifying headers for all pages or a subset of pages

Middleware is *not* a good fit for:

- Slow data fetching
- Session management

Using fetch with `options.cache`, `options.next.revalidate`, or `options.next.tags`, has no effect in Middleware.

### Convention

Create a `middleware.ts` (or `.js`) file in the project root, or inside `src` if applicable, so that it is located at the same level as `pages` or `app`.

> **Note**: While only one `middleware.ts` file is supported per project, you can still organize your middleware logic into modules. Break out middleware functionalities into separate `.ts` or `.js` files and import them into your main `middleware.ts` file. This allows for cleaner management of route-specific middleware, aggregated in the `middleware.ts` for centralized control. By enforcing a single middleware file, it simplifies configuration, prevents potential conflicts, and optimizes performance by avoiding multiple middleware layers.

### Example

middleware.ts

```
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

 

// This function can be marked \`async\` if using \`await\` inside

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {

  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))

}

 

// See "Matching Paths" below to learn more

export const config = {

  matcher: '/about/:path*',

}
```
